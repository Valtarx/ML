There are two kinds of flowers on a farm - red and blue.

It is known that these kinds have different sizes. 

Size of red flowers varies in the next ranges:
Length - from 1 to 3 cm
Width - from 1 to 1.75 cm

Size of blue flowers varies in the next ranges:
Length - from 0.5 to 1.5 cm
Width - from 0.5 to 1.25 cm

These ranges are not strict so some flowers can be extraodinary. :)

Firstly, I created a sample list of flowers' sizes and colors using random. I made samples as thouhg they were selected from normal distribution. Then I used it to teach my neural network to distinguish flowers by their sizes. After that I randomly created sample of sizes for testing NN.

At the end of the work program shows a grid with red and blue dots. The dots with black edge are the predicted dots that show the result of the neural network's activity.
